Okay, identifying skills from your comprehensive list that are least likely to have a direct, granular match in a standardized taxonomy like Lightcast requires looking for a few patterns:

Hyper-Specific Variants: Skills describing a very specific method or sub-type of a broader technique.

Process/Workflow Names: Skills named after internal processes, board meetings, or specific workflow steps rather than the underlying capability.

Combined Concepts: Skills bundling multiple distinct ideas.

Company/Domain Specific Jargon: Terms or acronyms potentially unique to your company or a very niche aerospace sub-field not widely recognized market-wide.

Abstract or Vague Concepts: Very high-level or abstract terms.

"Familiarity with" or "Understanding of": These often point to knowledge about something, where Lightcast would likely list the core skill itself.

Disclaimer: This is an estimation. Without cross-referencing against the live Lightcast database, it's impossible to be certain. Lightcast is extensive, but its goal is standardization. You MUST validate this with the actual Lightcast data/API.

Here's a list of skills from your input that seem less likely to have a direct 1:1 mapping in Lightcast, based on the criteria above:

Likely Needing Mapping to Broader Skills or Custom Tags:

Hyper-Specific / Granular:

1D Aerodynamic Modeling (Likely maps to Aerodynamics, CFD, Modeling)

Fatigue Crack Growth (Compliance) (Likely maps to Fatigue Analysis, Fracture Mechanics, Material Testing)

Fatigue Crack Growth (Potential Drop PD) (Likely maps to Fatigue Analysis, Fracture Mechanics, Material Testing)

Algorithms High BW Arch / Algorithms Low BW Arch (Likely maps to Algorithm Design, System Architecture)

FPA assembly electronics – analog and power design (Maps to Analog Design, Power Electronics, potentially FPGA)

FPA assembly electronics – FPGA programming (Maps to FPGA, Digital Design)

Readout integrated circuit design – CMOS schematic and layout (Maps to CMOS, Integrated Circuit Design, ASIC Design, Layout)

Strain Control Fatigue (LCF) (Likely maps to Fatigue Analysis, Material Testing)

Strain Control Thermomechanical Fatigue (Likely maps to Fatigue Analysis, Material Testing, Thermal Analysis)

EW/EA DREX Architectures (Unless DREX is a known standard, maps to EW, System Architecture)

ARBE V2 Distributed Processing Framework (Unless ARBE V2 is standard, maps to Distributed Computing, specific framework if known)

DBF/ ELDBF Distributed Processing (Likely maps to Distributed Computing)

DBF/ELDBF RF Architectures (Likely maps to RF Engineering, System Architecture)

AlN-SiC, MgO-SiC, BeO - SiC (Likely maps to Material Science, Ceramics, Semiconductor Materials)

Process/Workflow/Board Names:

Addressing Non-Conformances & Deviation Requests (Maps to Quality Management, Process Improvement, Problem Solving)

Failure Analysis Board (FAB) (Involves skills like Root Cause Analysis, Reliability Eng., but FAB itself is a process meeting)

Failure Review Boards (FRBs) (Similar to FAB)

Product Safety Board Management / Product Safety Board Process (Involves Safety Engineering, Risk Management, Process Management skills)

Flight Test Readiness Review (Involves Test Planning, Systems Engineering, Safety Assessment skills)

Development Plan Process

Frozen Process Review

Process: Certification Audit / Process: Certification Planning (Maps to Certification, Auditing, Process Management)

Process: SW Dev & Verification / Process: CI/CD & Release (Maps to SW Development Lifecycle, CI/CD, Release Management)

Program product-specific parts application management (Maps to Configuration Management, Component Engineering, PLM)

Combined Concepts / Context-Specific:

Adhesives, Coatings, Paints for Electronic Optics (Maps to Adhesives, Coatings, Paints, Optical Engineering, Material Science)

Design for antenna gimbal mass balancing (Maps to Mechanical Design, Dynamics, Control Systems)

Design for assembly tooling and thermal conditioning (Maps to Tool Design, Thermal Engineering, DFM)

Export Control Compliance and Integration for Electronic Components (Maps to Export Compliance, Component Engineering)

Structural Analysis for Electro-Optics (Maps to Structural Analysis, FEA, Optical Engineering)

Structural Materials for Electro-Optics (Maps to Material Science, Structural Engineering, Optical Engineering)

FADEC Hardware Software Interface / FADEC Hardware-Software Integration Verification (HSIT) (Maps to FADEC Systems, HW/SW Integration, Systems Integration, Verification)

Vague/Abstract or "Understanding":

Above-the-Pack (Meaning unclear without context, likely internal jargon)

Abstractions / Abstraction Layers (Likely map to Software Design, System Architecture)

Process Domain Knowledge (Too generic - Lightcast would list specific domains)

System & Application Understanding (Too generic)

Familiarity with IPC, locate and read specs (Maps to IPC Standards, Technical Documentation)

Aftermarket Repair Operation Understanding (Maps to MRO Processes, Repair Engineering)

Manufacturing Escape (Describes an event, not a skill - related skills are Quality Control, Root Cause Analysis)

Action Phrases (Implied Skill is Likely in Lightcast):

Analyze system test approach (Maps to Test Strategy, Systems Analysis)

Manage eCAD data in the PLM system (Maps to PLM Software, ECAD, Data Management)

Read Code (Maps to Code Review, specific Programming Languages)

Why these are less likely direct matches:

Standardized taxonomies usually operate at a slightly higher level of abstraction than hyper-specific techniques unless those techniques are universally named and recognized (like FMEA or Six Sigma).

They focus on the underlying skill or competency, not the specific company process, meeting name, or workflow step where the skill is applied.

They tend to list foundational skills rather than highly contextual combinations (like materials for a specific application type).

Recommendation:

For the skills listed above, you will likely need to:

Map to Best Fit: Find the closest corresponding (often broader) Lightcast skill(s).

Use Multiple Mappings: A single custom skill might map to several Lightcast skills.

Retain Custom Tags: For truly unique or process-critical items with no good equivalent, keep your internal tag alongside any broader Lightcast mapping for internal reporting needs.

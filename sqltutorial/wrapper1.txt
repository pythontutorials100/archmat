Okay, here are the key points distilled into a slide-friendly format:

Slide 1: Title

    Aerospace Ontology Hub (Gatsby Version)

    Your User-Friendly Gateway to Semantic Assets

Slide 2: Vision & Purpose

    Goal: Central portal to Discover, Understand, Document & Use company ontologies.

    Value-Add Layer: Sits on top of the internal MOBI ontology repository.

    Key Functions:

        Improve Ontology Discoverability (beyond raw files).

        Provide Context: Company-specific docs, usage, examples.

        Show Governance: Status, versions, contacts.

        Highlight Applications: Showcase project usage.

        Centralize Learning: Articles, tutorials, patterns (Key Focus).

        Connect People: Visibility into teams & projects.

    Bridge: Connects technical MOBI repo with end-users (Engineers, Data Scientists, etc.).

Slide 3: Core Architecture (Gatsby + Strapi + MOBI API)

    Internal MOBI API:

        Role: Authoritative source for ontology files (OWL, TTL) & core metadata (IRI, version).

        Interaction: Provides API for lists, details, download links.

    Strapi CMS:

        Role: Backend for all contextual & narrative content (docs, projects, status, articles, tutorials, team info).

        Interaction: Managed via Admin UI; provides content API (REST/GraphQL).

    Gatsby Frontend:

        Role: Fast, static user-facing website (React, Tailwind).

        Interaction:

            Build Time: Fetches data from both MOBI API & Strapi API via source plugins.

            Build Time: Merges data using GraphQL data layer.

            Build Time: Generates static HTML pages for high performance.

            User Experience: Delivers pre-built pages instantly.

Slide 4: Key Content & Features

    Ontology Hub:

        Foundational & Domain Ontology listings & details.

        Search & Filtering capabilities.

        Combines MOBI data (core facts, download) with Strapi data (docs, usage, status).

    Project Showcase:

        See how ontologies are used in real projects.

        Managed via Strapi (details, teams, ontologies used).

    Resource Center (Crucial):

        Articles, Tutorials, Modeling Patterns, Use Cases.

        Central place for learning & best practices (Managed in Strapi).

    Other: Direct link to MOBI Catalog, Team Directory, Contact Info.

Slide 5: Why Gatsby + Strapi?

    Performance: Gatsby's Static Site Generation (SSG) = Extremely fast load times.

    Content Management: Strapi provides an easy UI for non-developers to manage rich context, docs, articles, tutorials.

    Data Aggregation: Gatsby excels at pulling data from multiple sources (MOBI API, Strapi API) at build time via GraphQL.

    Developer Experience: Clear separation of concerns; robust tooling (React, GraphQL, Plugins).

    Single Source of Truth (Layered): MOBI for ontologies, Strapi for context, Gatsby Hub for presentation.

    Tailored: Built specifically for internal needs and integration with MOBI.
